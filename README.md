This project is just to learn HTML, CSS, and the most important of the three, JavaScript. It's in Portuguese for now because itÂ´s my native language. The major objective of sharing the project here is to see my progress. For now, I don't have much time because I have a job in another area. I've studied Visual Studio in college, but it has been 5 years. I was good at it, and I'm trying to be better than ever. More updates are comming.
